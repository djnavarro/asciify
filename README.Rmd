A package to create ASCII art from arbitrary images. At the moment the documentation is more or less nonexistent. 

```{r install}
# devtools::install_github("djnavarro/asciify")
library("asciify")
```

The core function is `ascii_map`:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
bayes_img <- here::here("inst", "extdata", "thomas-bayes.png")
bayes_map <- ascii_map(filename = bayes_img)
bayes_map
```

There's a minimalistic plot function:
```{r plotting}
ascii_plot(bayes_map, charsize = 2)
```

You can convert to a matrix "grid" of characters:

```{r}
bayes_grid <- ascii_grid(bayes_map)
str(bayes_grid)
```

You can write this matrix to a text file using `ascii_text`

```{r}
#ascii_text(bayes_grid, file = "something.txt")
```

You can also write an HTML version with a "rain" animation

```{r}
#ascii_rain(bayes_grid, file = "something.html")
```
